# MVP Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the essential monitoring features needed for our MVP/beta launch. We're focusing on critical metrics that will help us understand application health, user behavior, and core business metrics.

## Critical Features

### 1. Application Health Monitoring (Priority: Highest)
- [ ] New Relic Free Tier Implementation
  ```typescript
  // Key metrics to track
  interface CoreMetrics {
    apiLatency: number;     // API response times
    errorRate: number;      // % of failed requests
    databaseLatency: number; // Query response times
    memoryUsage: number;    // Server memory utilization
  }
  ```
  
#### Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Install New Relic Node.js agent
2. [ ] Configure basic monitoring:
   - [ ] API endpoint health
   - [ ] Database connection status
   - [ ] Error tracking
   - [ ] Server resource usage
3. [ ] Set up critical alerts for:
   - [ ] API downtime
   - [ ] Database connection failures
   - [ ] High error rates (>5%)
   - [ ] Memory leaks

### 2. Core User Analytics (Priority: High)
- [ ] Mixpanel Free Tier Setup
  ```typescript
  // Essential user events
  interface CoreUserEvents {
    // Authentication
    userSignUp: { userId: string; timestamp: Date; }
    userLogin: { userId: string; timestamp: Date; }
    
    // Core Features
    bookingCreated: { userId: string; bookingId: string; }
    bookingCompleted: { userId: string; bookingId: string; }
    
    // Integration Events
    calendlyScheduled: { userId: string; eventType: string; }
    zoomMeetingCreated: { userId: string; meetingId: string; }
    
    // Payment Events
    paymentInitiated: { userId: string; amount: number; }
    paymentCompleted: { userId: string; amount: number; }
  }
  ```

#### Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Install Mixpanel SDK
2. [ ] Implement core event tracking
3. [ ] Create essential dashboards:
   - [ ] User acquisition funnel
   - [ ] Booking completion rates
   - [ ] Payment success rates
   - [ ] Integration success rates

### 3. Error Tracking (Priority: High)
- [ ] Basic error logging implementation
  ```typescript
  interface ErrorLog {
    timestamp: Date;
    errorCode: string;
    message: string;
    userId?: string;
    context: {
      path: string;
      action: string;
      integrationPoint?: string;
    }
  }
  ```

#### Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Set up error logging middleware
2. [ ] Implement error collection for:
   - [ ] API failures
   - [ ] Integration failures (Calendly, Zoom, Stripe)
   - [ ] Authentication errors
   - [ ] Payment processing errors
3. [ ] Create error monitoring dashboard

### 4. Integration Health (Priority: High)
Monitor status of critical third-party services:
- [ ] Clerk (Authentication)
- [ ] Supabase (Database)
- [ ] Calendly
- [ ] Zoom
- [ ] Stripe

#### Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Implement health checks for each integration
2. [ ] Set up basic status dashboard
3. [ ] Configure alerts for integration failures

## Environment Variables
```env
# New Relic
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=
NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=dibs-beta

# Mixpanel
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN=
MIXPANEL_PROJECT_ID=

# Error Logging
ERROR_LOGGING_LEVEL=error
```

## MVP Success Metrics
- [ ] 99.9% API uptime
- [ ] <2% error rate across all operations
- [ ] 100% visibility into integration failures
- [ ] <1s average API response time
- [ ] 95% booking completion rate
- [ ] 98% payment processing success rate

## Implementation Timeline
### Week 1
- Set up New Relic basic monitoring
- Implement core error tracking
- Configure critical alerts

### Week 2
- Set up Mixpanel event tracking
- Implement integration health monitoring
- Create monitoring dashboard

## Notes
- Focus on monitoring that directly impacts user experience
- Prioritize actionable metrics over vanity metrics
- Keep implementation simple and maintainable
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Monitor only what we can actively respond to

## Next Steps After MVP
1. Implement user session recording
2. Add detailed performance monitoring
3. Set up synthetic API testing
4. Implement user feedback collection
5. Add detailed user journey tracking
