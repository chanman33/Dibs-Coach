 # Organization Membership Management - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for improving how users discover and manage their organization memberships within the application. Currently, users have no clear way to know when they've been added to an organization or to navigate between multiple organization memberships.

## Problem Statement
Users who have been added to organizations have no intuitive way to:
1. Discover which organizations they belong to
2. Switch between different organization contexts
3. Understand their role and permissions within each organization
4. Access organization-specific features and content

This creates confusion and reduces productivity as users may be unaware of the full extent of their access rights and available resources.

## Goals
- Provide clear visibility of organization memberships
- Enable easy switching between organizations
- Display relevant organization context within the user interface
- Improve the overall user experience for multi-organization users

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in support tickets related to organization access
- Increased engagement with organization-specific features
- Improved user satisfaction ratings for organization members
- Higher retention rate for users with multiple organization memberships

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Organization Switcher Component (Priority: HIGH)

#### Description
Implement a dropdown component in the application header that allows users to view and switch between organizations they are members of.

#### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see which organizations I belong to from any page in the application
- As a user, I want to quickly switch between different organizations I'm a member of
- As a user, I want to see my role within each organization
- As a user, I want to see which organization context I'm currently working in

#### Requirements

**1.1 Component Placement**
- The organization switcher should be prominently displayed in the header/navigation area
- It should be accessible from all pages after user login

**1.2 Component Design**
- Display current active organization name and possibly logo/icon
- Dropdown menu that shows all organizations the user is a member of
- Indicate user's role in each organization (e.g., Admin, Member)
- Highlight the currently active organization
- Include a direct link to "View All Organizations" that takes the user to the My Organizations page

**1.3 Functionality**
- Clicking an organization in the dropdown should switch the user's context to that organization
- The application should remember the last selected organization for the user
- The active organization should be stored in localStorage and/or user session
- All relevant views should update to reflect the selected organization's context

**1.4 Technical Considerations**
- Create a React context provider for organization context
- Implement persistent storage of the active organization preference
- Ensure all API calls include the current organization context where relevant
- Add functionality to fetch user's organization memberships from the backend

### 2. "My Organizations" Dashboard Section (Priority: HIGH)

#### Description
Create a dedicated page/section in the user dashboard that lists all organizations the user belongs to and provides management capabilities.

#### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see all organizations I belong to in one place
- As a user, I want to view details about each organization
- As a user, I want to access organization-specific features from a central location
- As a user, I want to understand my role and permissions in each organization

#### Requirements

**2.1 Page Structure**
- Create a new route at `/dashboard/my-organizations`
- Add a link to this page in the main navigation/sidebar
- Ensure the page is accessible to all authenticated users

**2.2 Organization Listing**
- Display all organizations the user is a member of in a card or table format
- Show for each organization:
  - Organization name and type
  - Organization status (Active, Pending, etc.)
  - User's role within the organization
  - Membership status and join date
  - Organization tier/plan
  - Quick actions (Switch to, View Details)

**2.3 Filtering and Sorting**
- Allow users to filter organizations by status, type, or role
- Provide sorting options (alphabetical, join date, etc.)
- Include a search function to find organizations by name or ID

**2.4 Detail View**
- Clicking on an organization should expand details or navigate to a dedicated page
- Organization detail view should display:
  - Comprehensive organization information
  - User's specific permissions and role details
  - List of features/access enabled by their membership
  - Relevant activity within the organization (if applicable)

**2.5 Technical Considerations**
- Create a new API endpoint to fetch user's organization memberships with details
- Implement efficient loading and pagination for users with many organizations
- Ensure proper data caching to minimize API calls

### 3. User Profile Integration (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### Description
Enhance the user profile dropdown and overall UI to reflect the current organization context and provide quick access to organization settings.

#### User Stories
- As a user, I want to see which organization I'm currently working in throughout the UI
- As a user, I want quick access to change organizations from my user profile
- As a user, I want visual indicators that help me understand my current context

#### Requirements

**3.1 Profile Dropdown Enhancements**
- Add current organization information to the user profile dropdown
- Include a shortcut to switch organizations
- Show the user's role in the current organization
- Add a link to the My Organizations page

**3.2 Global Context Indicators**
- Add subtle visual indicators throughout the UI showing the current organization context
- Consider using organization colors, badges, or tags to reinforce the active context
- Ensure consistent branding/theming based on the active organization where appropriate

**3.3 Organization-Specific Navigation**
- Dynamically adjust navigation options based on the user's role in the current organization
- Show/hide features based on organization tier and user permissions
- Provide clear indicators when certain features are unavailable due to organization tier limitations

**3.4 Technical Considerations**
- Update the user context to include organization information
- Ensure all API requests include the current organization context
- Implement responsive design to accommodate various organization name lengths
- Create a global organization context provider that components can access

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Components (2-3 weeks)
- Develop the organization context provider and state management
- Implement the Organization Switcher component
- Create the backend APIs to fetch user organization memberships

### Phase 2: My Organizations Page (2 weeks)
- Design and implement the My Organizations dashboard page
- Build filtering, sorting, and search functionality
- Implement organization detail views

### Phase 3: UI Integration (1-2 weeks)
- Enhance the user profile dropdown
- Add visual context indicators throughout the application
- Test and optimize the user experience

## Future Roadmap

The following features are planned for future releases:

### 1. User Notification System
- Email notifications when added to an organization
- In-app notifications for organization membership changes
- Organization activity digests and updates

### 2. Onboarding Experience
- Special welcome experience for new organization members
- Guided tours of organization-specific features
- Organization-specific onboarding checklists

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoints Needed

```
GET /api/user/organizations
  - Returns all organizations the user is a member of
  - Includes role, permissions, and organizational metadata

POST /api/user/organizations/setActive
  - Sets the user's active organization context
  - Updates user preferences

GET /api/organizations/:id/context
  - Returns detailed information about the specific organization
  - Includes user's role and permissions in this context
```

### Data Models

```typescript
// Organization Context
interface OrganizationContext {
  organizationUlid: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  tier: string;
  permissions: string[];
  features: string[];
  customSettings?: Record<string, any>;
}

// User Organization Membership
interface OrganizationMembership {
  ulid: string;
  organizationUlid: string;
  organization: {
    name: string;
    type: string;
    industry?: string;
    status: string;
    tier: string;
  };
  role: string;
  status: string;
  joinedAt: string;
  scope?: string;
  customPermissions?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Design Guidelines

- The organization switcher should be consistent with the application's existing design language
- Use visual hierarchy to emphasize the current active organization
- Employ color, icons, and typography to differentiate between organizations
- Ensure all components are accessible and work on mobile devices
- Provide clear feedback when switching between organizations
- Use skeleton loaders during data fetching to maintain a responsive feel

## Conclusion

Implementing these features will significantly improve the experience for users who belong to multiple organizations. By providing clear visibility and easy navigation between different organizational contexts, we can reduce confusion and increase productivity.
