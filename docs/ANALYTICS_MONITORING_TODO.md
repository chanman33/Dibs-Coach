    userRegistration: { userId: string; source: string; }
    userLogin: { userId: string; deviceType: string; }
    featureUsage: { featureId: string; userId: string; duration: number; }
    
    // Business Events
    conversion: { userId: string; planType: string; amount: number; }
    churn: { userId: string; reason?: string; }
    
    // Error Events
    errorOccurrence: { errorId: string; userId?: string; context: string; }
  }
  ```
