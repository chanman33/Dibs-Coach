# Organization Permissions Management PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and implementation details for the Organization Permissions Management system. The permissions system will enable organizations to define and enforce role-based access controls, manage employee permissions for booking coaching sessions, and create hierarchical approval workflows, with a focus on employers who are managing employee access to coaching resources.

## Problem Statement

Organizations need a comprehensive permissions system to:
1. Manage which employees can book coaching sessions
2. Define administrative roles for billing and reporting access
3. Create approval workflows for exceeding spending limits
4. Enforce department-level access control
5. Provide fine-grained control over system features

## User Personas

### Organization Owner
- Defines organizational roles and permissions
- Assigns administrative access
- Sets system-wide policies
- Has ultimate authorization authority

### Administrative Staff
- Manages day-to-day platform usage
- Assigns roles to employees
- Processes approvals
- Monitors system usage

### Department Manager
- Manages team-level permissions
- Approves coaching requests
- Views department analytics
- Manages direct reports' access

### Employee
- Books coaching sessions within permissions
- Requests access to additional resources
- Operates within defined permission boundaries

## Goals and Success Metrics

### Business Goals
- Reduce unauthorized access incidents by 95%
- Decrease permission-related support tickets by 70%

## Technical Requirements

### Database Changes
- Extend `RolePermission` and `OrganizationMember` models
- Create new models:
  - `PermissionRequest`
  - `ApprovalWorkflow`
  - `PermissionAuditLog`
  - `AccessControl`

### API Requirements
- Create RESTful endpoints for all permission operations
- Implement permission verification middleware
- Build permission checking utilities for frontend
- Create approval workflow APIs

### Integration Requirements
- Notification system for approval requests
- Audit logging for compliance purposes
- Integration with organizational structure

## User Flows

### Permission Assignment Flow
1. Admin navigates to user management
2. Selects target user(s)
3. Assigns role(s) and permissions
4. Sets custom permissions if needed
5. Confirms changes
6. System logs change and notifies user

### Coaching Access Request Flow
1. Employee navigates to coaching request
2. System checks existing permissions
3. If request exceeds permissions, approval workflow triggered
4. Manager receives request notification
5. Manager approves/denies with comments
6. Employee receives outcome notification

### Admin Delegation Flow
1. Owner navigates to admin management
2. Selects user to promote to admin role
3. Defines administrative scope
4. Sets permissions boundaries
5. Configures approval requirements
6. New admin receives role notification

## UI/UX Requirements

### Permission Management Dashboard
- Role management matrix
- User permission overview
- Bulk edit capabilities
- Permission search and filter tools
- Audit log viewer

### Approval Management Interface
- Pending requests queue
- Approval action buttons
- Request details panel
- History of past decisions
- Bulk approval capabilities

### User Permission Profile
- Visual permission summary
- Access request interface
- Permission history timeline
- Role visualization

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core RBAC (Weeks 1-2) [URGENT]
- Basic role definitions
- Permission assignment
- Essential access controls
- Foundation for coaching booking permissions

### Phase 2: Coaching Access Controls (Weeks 2-3) [URGENT]
- Session booking permissions
- Coach access restrictions
- Basic spending controls
- Permission checking in booking flow

### Phase 3: Approval Workflows (Weeks 3-4) [HIGH PRIORITY]
- Approval chain configuration
- Request management
- Notification integration
- Status tracking

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6) [HIGH PRIORITY]
- Administrative delegation
- Analytics access control
- Audit improvements
- Custom role creation

## Migration and Rollout Plan

### Data Migration
- Map existing roles to new permission system
- Set default permissions based on current access
- Preserve existing administrative assignments

### Rollout Strategy
- Deploy permission backend system (Day 1)
- Enable core roles for all organizations (Day 2)
- Roll out approval workflows (Week 2)
- Introduce advanced features (Week 4)

## Success Criteria
- 95% of permission changes completed without support tickets
- Average time to assign new roles <1 minute
- Approval requests processed within 24 hours
- Zero unauthorized access incidents

## Future Considerations
